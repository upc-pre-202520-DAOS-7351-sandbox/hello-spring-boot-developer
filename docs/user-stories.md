This document contains the technical stories for the `hello-spring-boot-developer` REST API from the perspective of a developer interacting with it through HTTP requests.
The stories are simplified to focus on basic scenarios, by giving examples of the input and expected output.

## TS01: Retrieve Greeting via GET Request
**As a developer**, I want to retrieve a greeting by providing optional first and last names, so that I can test the API with both named and anonymous inputs.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Scenario 1: Anonymous Greeting**
    - **Given** a developer has not provided any names,
    - **When** the developer requests a greeting via GET,
    - **Then** the developer receives a response with the message "Welcome Anonymous Spring Boot Developer".

- **Scenario 2: Personalized Greeting**
    - **Given** a developer has provided the first name "John" and last name "Doe",
    - **When** the developer requests a greeting via GET,
    - **Then** the developer receives a response containing a unique identifier, the full name "John Doe", and the message "Congrats John Doe! You are a Spring Boot Developer".

- **Scenario 3: Partial Input**
    - **Given** a developer has provided only the first name "John" without a last name,
    - **When** the developer requests a greeting via GET,
    - **Then** the developer receives a response with the message "Welcome Anonymous Spring Boot Developer".
